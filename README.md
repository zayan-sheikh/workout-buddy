# Workout Buddy 💪
This project was inspired by a series of YouTube tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BzS5Oz5E4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iJ_KkrkBZWZRHVwnzLIoUE&ab_channel=NetNinja) to help me learn the MERN stack, and will serve as a catalyst for me to build even more complex applications in future.

## Technologies Used
MongoDB (to store exercises), Express.js (middleware), React (for the UI), Node.js (middleware), Mongoose (to model exercise objects)
