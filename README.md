# Workout Buddy
This project was inspired by a series of YouTube tutorials to help me learn the MERN stack, and will serve as a catalyst for me to build even more complex applications in future.

## Technologies Used
MongoDB (to store exercises), Express.js (middleware), React (for the UI), Node.js (middleware), Mongoose (to model exercise objects)

### A Preview of the Project
